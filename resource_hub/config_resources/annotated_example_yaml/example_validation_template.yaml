# ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation Suite - Validation Config Template
#
# This file defines a validation configuration used to evaluate a trained model
# (loaded from the MLflow Model Registry) against a holdout dataset. It is used
# with `validate_champion.py` to generate performance dashboards, segmentation plots,
# and audit alerts for a given model version.
#
# Edit this file to specify your MLflow model details, holdout test data,
# and reporting controls.
# ---
# ---
# ðŸ§ª Example Usage
# 
# To run this validation config from a script or notebook:
#
# Python:
# from model_eval_suite.validate_champion import validate_and_display
# validate_and_display("example_config/example_validation_template.yaml")
#
# CLI (if supported):
# python -m model_eval_suite.validate_champion --config example_config/example_validation_template.yaml
